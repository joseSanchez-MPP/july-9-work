//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
34 + 56 + 230

1000 - 300

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 12
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
24 / 10

//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(300 + 500 + 400) / 3

(45 - 7) + 134 / 2

13 + 2

4444 - 32443

-4231 * -4423

-3513 + 5000
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
